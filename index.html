    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
    <p>I am a Navy veteran of four years. I have two children, ages 12 years and 8 months. Currently, I work in IT in the banking industry as an overnight Operations Technician. In my spare time, I like to go to concerts and on road trips.</p>

    <p>I am a lifelong Kansas City Chiefs fan, and am happy to have finally seen a Super Bowl victory in my lifetime. Go Chiefs!</p>
